performance of the Lovable Services under the terms of the Agreement;
where applicable depending on the Lovable Services provided to the Customer under the Agreement, setting up, operating, and monitoring the underlying infrastructure (hardware, software, servers, environments, connectivity, etc) required to provide the Lovable Services to the Customer and to meet the technical, security and organizational requirements for the processing of the personal data in connection therewith;

Lovable will report to the Customer without undue delay any request, demand or order received by Lovable from a competent supervisory authority or a data subject relating to the processing of personal data on the Customer's behalf. If a data subject makes a request to Lovable, Lovable will promptly forward such request to Customer once Lovable has identified that the request is from a data subject for whom Customer is responsible. The Customer acknowledges that Lovable has no responsibility to interact directly with any data subject or supervisory authority in respect of any request, demand or order (except as expressly provided under the Applicable Data Protection Law or as otherwise agreed by the Parties in writing).
Subject to applicable legal retention obligations, upon termination of the Agreement Lovable will return to the Customer or delete any personal data that has been processed on the Customer's behalf under this DPA, as described in this DPA.
Lovable will only rely on personnel in the processing of personal data who are contractually or by statutory obligation bound to maintain confidentiality, and take reasonable steps to ensure that access to personal data processed is limited to those personnel who require such access to perform the applicable services.
Lovable will promptly inform the Customer if, in its opinion, any instruction or request violates Applicable Data Protection Law, and Lovable disclaims any obligation or liability with regard to any such instructions or requests.

Lovable shall be entitled to charge the Customer its professional services fees on a time and material basis for such assistance.
The Customer accepts that any requests for information, assistance or activities beyond Lovable's ordinary course of business, routines or practices, or what is otherwise commercially reasonable, shall be specifically agreed in an Order Form and may be subject to additional fees and charges.
Implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.
Nothing in this Section 4 obliges Lovable to take actions that (i) would violate Applicable Data Protection Laws or Applicable Law, (ii) require disclosure of trade secrets or confidential information of third parties, or (iii) exceed the limitation-of-liability caps set forth in this DPA.
5. Security

In connection with its processing of personal data hereunder Lovable shall provide for and maintain appropriate administrative, physical, technical and organizational security measures for such processing, which are intended to protect personal data against accidental or unauthorized loss, destruction, alteration, disclosure or access, and to ensure a level of security appropriate to the particular risks involved in the processing, as outlined on Lovable's Security Page: https://lovable.dev/security
Lovable shall maintain SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 accreditations for the duration of the term of the Agreement. Upon request, approval and acceptance to confidentiality obligations, Lovable may provide access to the recent SOC 2 Type II & ISO 27001 reports.
6. Data Breach Notification

Lovable will inform the Customer without undue delay after confirming a data breach, that constitutes a Personal Data Breach under this DPA and/or Applicable Data Protection Laws, in connection with the processing of Customer Personal Data under this DPA, observing the following process:
Lovable shall investigate the personal data breach and take reasonable measures to identify its root cause(s), where such breach is caused by Lovable or a Lovable Sub-processor;
As information is collected or otherwise becomes available, to the extent legally permitted, Lovable shall provide the Customer with a description of the Personal Data Breach, the type of the data to which the Personal Data Breach relates, and, other information the Customer may reasonably request concerning the affected data subject(s) where such information is available to Lovable; and,
Lovable will provide the Customer with reports as follow-up to the notice, on a timely basis, and as reasonably requested by the Customer.
Lovable's notification of or response to a Personal Data Breach shall not be construed as Lovable's acknowledgement of any fault or liability with respect to the Personal Data Breach.
If the Customer determines to notify any governmental entity, Data Subject(s), the public or others of a Personal Data Breach, to the extent such notice directly or indirectly refers to or identifies Lovable, where permitted by Applicable Data Protection Laws, the Customer agrees to:
Notify Lovable in writing in advance; and
In good faith, consult with Lovable and consider any clarifications or corrections Lovable may reasonably recommend or request to any such notification, which: (i) relate to Lovable's involvement in or relevance to such Personal Data Breach; and (ii) are consistent with Applicable Data Protection Laws.
Lovable may delay notice to the Customer if a competent law-enforcement agency determines that immediate disclosure would impede a criminal investigation, provided Lovable notifies the Customer as soon as the restriction is lifted.
The obligations set out above will not apply, to the extent that the personal data breach is caused by the Customer, the Customer's Affiliate or anyone acting for the Customer, save that Lovable will inform the Customer of the personal data breach and provide information it discovers up to the stage it identifies the breach is caused by the Customer, the Customer's Affiliate or anyone acting for the Customer. Lovable may charge the Customer for any assistance that the Customer may request when a personal data breach is attributable to or caused by the Customer.
7. Sub-processing

Lovable shall inform the Customer of any intended changes concerning the addition or replacement of other processors through updating the sub-processor list available at https://enterprise.lovable.dev/subprocessors (the "Sub-processor List"). This list is updated at least annually.
Lovable may continue to use those Sub-processors already engaged by Lovable as of the date of this DPA.
In the event that the Customer does not wish to consent to the use of a new Sub-processor, the Customer may notify Lovable within twenty (20) business days of Lovable notifying the Customer, that the Customer does not consent on reasonable grounds relating to the protection of Personal Data by contacting privacy@lovable.dev.
In such cases, the Customer and Lovable shall work together in good faith to find a mutually acceptable resolution to address such objections. If the parties are unable to reach a mutually acceptable resolution within a reasonable timeframe, the Customer may, as its sole and exclusive remedy, terminate the Agreement and cancel the Lovable Services by providing written notice to Lovable and receive a refund of any prepaid fees under the Agreement.
Where Lovable engages another processor for carrying out specific processing activities on behalf of the Customer, the same data protection obligations as set out in this DPA shall be imposed on that other processor by way of a contract.
8. International Data Transfers

Lovable shall not transfer Personal Data to a third country or international organization unless:
The transfer is to a country or organization that has been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection by the European Commission or applicable regulatory authority;
The transfer is covered by appropriate safeguards such as binding corporate rules, standard data protection clauses, approved codes of conduct, or certification mechanisms; or
The Customer has given its explicit consent to the transfer after having been informed of the potential risks.
For ex-EEA Transfers, the parties agree that such transfers are made pursuant to the EU SCCs, which are deemed incorporated into this DPA by reference and completed as follows:
Module Two (Controller to Processor) of the EU SCCs apply when the Customer is a controller, and Lovable is processing Personal Data for the Customer as a processor.
Module Three (Processor to Sub-Processor) of the EU SCCs apply when the Customer is a processor, and Lovable is processing Personal Data on behalf of the Customer as a sub-processor.
For ex-UK Transfers, the parties agree that such transfers are made pursuant to the UK SCCs, which are deemed incorporated into this DPA by reference, and amended and completed in accordance with the UK Addendum.
Lovable represents and warrants that:
As of the date of this DPA, it has not received any formal legal requests from any government intelligence or security service for access to Customer Personal Data ("Government Agency Requests");
If, after the date of this DPA, Lovable receives any Government Agency Requests, it shall attempt to redirect the law enforcement or government agency to request that data directly from the Customer and shall give the Customer reasonable notice of the demand, unless legally prohibited from doing so.
If any transfer mechanism relied upon becomes invalid or is enjoined, the parties will cooperate in good faith to promptly implement an alternative lawful mechanism. Lovable may suspend the affected transfers (and related processing) until such mechanism is in place, without this constituting a breach of the Agreement.
9. Service Data

The Customer acknowledges and agrees that Lovable may collect, use and disclose Service Data for its own business purposes, such as but not limited to:
accounting, tax, billing, audit, and compliance purposes;
to provide, improve, develop, optimize and maintain the Services; to investigate fraud, spam, wrongful or unlawful use of the Services;
training or tuning proprietary machine-learning models used to deliver the Services;
and/or as otherwise permitted or required by Applicable Data Protection Laws.
For the avoidance of doubt, Service Data is not "Customer Personal Data" and the obligations set out in this DPA do not apply to Lovable's Processing of Service Data. Lovable may retain Service Data for as long as it has a legitimate business need, may disclose Service Data to its Affiliates and Sub-processors for the purposes set out in this Section, and may create, commercialize, and publish anonymized, aggregated, or de-identified data from Service Data, provided that such data does not identify the Customer or any individual Data Subject. Lovable warrants that any de-identification will meet the standard for "de-identified data" under the CPRA and comparable laws.
The Customer acknowledges that no royalty, fee, or other remuneration is due for Lovable's Processing of Service Data under this Section, and the Customer has no right to opt out of such Processing so long as it remains a customer of the Services.
10. Use of Customer Data for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

Lovable shall not use any Customer Personal Data for the purpose of training, retraining, fine-tuning, or otherwise developing any Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Learning (ML) models.
Customer Personal Data shall be processed solely for the purposes of providing, maintaining, securing, and supporting the Lovable Services as described in this DPA, in accordance with documented instructions and applicable data protection laws.
Lovable may process de-identified and aggregated information derived from Customer Personal Data (Service Data) only for statistical reporting, security analysis, or operational insights—provided that such information cannot be used to identify Customer, its end users, or any natural person, and is not used for AI/ML training.
11. Return and Deletion

Upon termination of the Agreement, Lovable shall immediately discontinue all processing of Customer Personal Data, other than secure storage or any processing expressly permitted under DPA.
Within thirty (30) calendar days after the termination of the Agreement the Customer may instruct Lovable, in writing, to return or delete all Customer Personal Data then in Lovable's possession or control, unless Applicable Data Protection Laws require storage of the Customer Personal Data.
If no such instruction is received within thirty (30) calendar days, Lovable may, at its discretion, permanently delete or irreversibly anonymize the Customer Personal Data in accordance with its documented retention schedule.
Where manual data-export or bespoke deletion work exceeds two (2) person-hours, Lovable may charge the Customer its reasonable, documented costs at the then-current professional-services rates, except to the extent such charges are prohibited by Applicable Data Protection Laws.
The provisions of this Section, together with Sections 12 (Governing Law and Jurisdiction) and 14 (Limitation of Liability), shall survive termination of DPA for so long as Lovable retains any Customer Personal Data.
12. Governing Law and Jurisdiction

This DPA, and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with it, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Terms of Service.

13. Indemnity

The Customer shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Lovable and its affiliates from any third-party claim, investigation, fine, loss, or reasonable legal cost that arises from (i) the Customer's instructions or configurations, (ii) failure to secure a lawful basis or required consents, (iii) provision of data to Lovable as described in Section 3.8, or (iv) any breach of this DPA or applicable data-protection laws. Lovable will give prompt written notice and reasonable cooperation; the Customer may control the defense but may not settle any matter that admits fault or imposes non-monetary obligations on Lovable without Lovable's prior written consent.
Further, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Customer releases and will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Lovable from any claim, fine, or loss arising out of the Customer's failure to implement or maintain the security controls described in this DPA.
14. Liability

The Parties' liability under this DPA shall be limited in accordance with the provisions of the General Terms and Conditions.
The Parties acknowledge and agree that neither Party shall have an obligation to indemnify the other Party for any administrative fines imposed by a supervisory authority or a court under Applicable Data Protection Legislation.
In no event shall either Party be liable to the other for any loss of profits, revenue, goodwill, business interruption, loss or corruption of data, or for any indirect, special, incidental, punitive, exemplary, or consequential damages of any kind, even if advised of the possibility of such loss or damage and regardless of the theory of liability. The foregoing limitations and exclusions apply (i) in the aggregate across this DPA and the Agreement, (ii) irrespective of the number or nature of claims, and (iii) notwithstanding any failure of essential purpose of any limited remedy.
15. US Privacy Laws

To the extent Lovable's Processing of Customer Personal Data under the Agreement is subject to U.S. Privacy Laws:
The Parties acknowledge that Lovable's retention, use and disclosure of Customer Personal Data authorized by the Customer's instructions stated in this Agreement are integral to the Lovable Services and the business relationship between the Parties.
Lovable shall:
Use, retain, and disclose Customer Personal Data only as necessary to perform the business purposes specified in this Agreement or as otherwise permitted by U.S. Privacy Laws;

Notify the Customer without undue delay if Lovable determines it cannot meet its obligations under U.S. Privacy Laws;
Cooperate with the Customer to stop and remediate any unauthorized use of Customer Personal Data.
Lovable shall not:
Sell or share any Customer Personal Data
Retain, use or disclose any Customer Personal Data for any purpose other than for the business purposes specified in the Agreement, including retaining, using, or disclosing the Customer Personal Data for a commercial purpose other than the business purposes specified in the Agreement or as otherwise permitted by U.S. Privacy Laws
Combine the Customer Personal Data received from the Customer with Customer Personal Data received from or on behalf another person, or Customer Personal Data Lovable collects from its own interaction with the consumer, except as otherwise permitted by U.S. Privacy Laws
De-identify or aggregate Customer Personal Data unless the de-identification meets U.S. Privacy Laws, and the output cannot be re-identified.
16. Miscellaneous

In the event of inconsistencies between the provisions of DPA and the Agreement, the provisions of DPA shall prevail.
If any provision of DPA is held invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force, and the Parties shall replace the invalid provision with a valid one that most closely reflects the Parties' original intent.
The Parties agree that DPA constitutes the entire understanding between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements or understandings, whether written or oral.
